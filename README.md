<b>Brief</b>
<br>
Your challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for interactive elements

*Technologies I used in this project were:

Flexbox;
Responsive Design;
Grid;
<br>
*Challenges I faced:

The project was pretty simple until I got to the hover and how to do that with the image. I spent about 1-2 hours trying things by myself until I had to actually google and youtube that and it worked but other then that I didnt encountered that many problems.

Another issue that creates problems for me centering the divs and using the responsive desing is still a challenge, I will try to get better at that.
